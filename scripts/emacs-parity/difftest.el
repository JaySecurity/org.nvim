;;; difftest.el --- Emacs side of the differential test (make difftest)  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Loaded after common.el (fixed "now", Org 9.8.10 check) by
;; tests/difftest/emacs.lua, which keeps this Emacs running and talks to
;; it over stdin/stdout, one request per line:
;;
;;   <oracle> TAB <input .org> TAB <output file> [TAB <plan>]
;;
;; For each request it writes what the oracle prints for the input to the
;; output file and answers "done <output file>" on stdout.  An oracle that
;; signals an error writes "!error <message>" as its only line.  EOF on
;; stdin ends the process.  The oracles and their org.nvim counterparts
;; (tests/difftest/oracles.lua) must print the same things:
;;
;;   export-<backend>  org-export-as, body only, Babel off (as export.el),
;;                     broken links marked
;;   agenda            "=== <view>" + the text of a few views over the file
;;   table             the buffer after recalculating every table with a
;;                     #+TBLFM line (org-table-recalculate 'all), top down;
;;                     a table whose formulas signal an error is left as
;;                     it was, followed by an "!error <message>" line
;;   visibility        "=== <step>" + "v"/"h" per line at startup and
;;                     after each of three S-TABs (org-cycle-global), or
;;                     "!error <message>" for a step that signals one
;;   commands          "=== <i> <step>" + the buffer after each step of the
;;                     plan (the request's fourth field, "cmd k[ k2];...",
;;                     see tests/difftest/commands.lua); a step that
;;                     signals an error without changing the buffer has
;;                     declined, one that changed it first adds an
